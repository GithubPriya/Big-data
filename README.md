# Big-data
Programming done on Hadoop
1. Written two Python scripts. The first one “load.py” creates a DynamoDB table and loads the first 1,000 records in (“data” section of) “lax.json” . The second one “search.py” performs  search function where it takes two keywords (that specify the search condition) as the input, and outputs the total number of passengers in the records that satisfy the condition.

2. Creating a Join Algorithm that will perform inner join operations on two input files located in different directories using Hadoop Map Reduce.
